`init.vim` was originally in `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

you need vim-plug to isntall plugins 
install it like this:
```bash
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```
after copying, you can install plugins by `:PlugInstall` 
and clean them with `:PlugClean` # note that this will clean plugins which is deleted from init.vim
