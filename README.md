# Roozbeh dotfiles 
here I will share my important dot files 
I'm actually newbie in writing Dotfiles, if you want to help me, I appreciate

## How to use
1. install packages with `./install-first.sh`
2. update (pull) from repository with `./bootstrap.sh`
3. Cheat sheet is available in `help.txt`, `vim-cheat.txt` and `emacs-cheat`


## Configurations
1. Neovim: config files is in `./.config/nvim`. Plugins are being managed by vim-plug. Install plugins with `:PlugInstall`. Using devicons depends on setting terminal font to `ubuntu font`
2. Zsh: recently migrated to Zsh. config files are in `./zshrc`
3. emacs: using doom mode. view `./doom.d`
3. Vim: using this [link](http://www.guillaume-barillot.com/2017/06/09/how-to-to-make-vim-to-look-like-atom/) to make it like atom. Install vim-plug and then run `:PlugInstall`
4. fish: fish config (in `./.config/fish`) have some good functions and customizations but let it be there and use some posix compliant shell
5. safe-rm: send removed items to trash! Also protect from accidental remove all files!
